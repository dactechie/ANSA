- IMPORTANT : mcq with "Other" + text answer could be for any of the mcqs 
            - the schema passed into Logic App needs to express this.


DONE - Mongo DB keys are not unique
      - can't be SLK as client can have multiple registrations, initial assessment etc. 
  Changed to default - autogenerate random ID


- SLK Generator PowerApp
    v1: SLK + Link generator .. Wohoo !
    
  Future versions : 
    v1.5: Add tracking query parameter -> 
    v2: SLK <-> Name, mapping stored in CDS
  

- Error situations - e.g. Missing Client ID  - report to client / how ? How to continue
  - if client-ID is not passed in, show the SLK field (careful about letting user entry here - no validation in SM)
    - email sent to staff with completed Word ITSP document and a warning message to let MJ know about it.
    - MJ to find the randomly generated ID in Cosmos and give it the correct SLK
